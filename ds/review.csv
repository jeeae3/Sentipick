There's so much to love here: Their awesome seafood, experimental dishes (try …",43
Natalie Gonzalez,1824,a month ago,"Small place but worth going to !!
Their sandwiches are really good
Coffee is great …",43
Hubert Skertchly,1825,a year ago,"Enswell service, vibe and cocktails were amazing. However all wesnt well (get it?), portions were meager even for a upscale restaurant and the “a mouse-bouche” was overhyped cheez its.",43
David Friess,1826,7 months ago,"Great interior with bar seating and limited table seating, plus some outside tables. Excellent service, cocktails and food. Brunch on weekends. Coffee bar for takeout was also busy.",43
Lauren Claxon,1827,a month ago,Beautiful restaurant and bar. Cocktails are wonderful. Food was delish. Portions are small but still shareable!,43
Kendra Hills,1828,4 months ago,"Surprised more people are not voicing how insane the food proportions are for the price? Am i missing something? Is brunch better?? Idk but the evening dining menu taste like airplane food on an shitty international flight, at BEST. Even the beautiful interior couldn’t make up for the food…we can’t normalize this!!!!!!!!!!!",43
Kent Johnson,1829,a year ago,"Gorgeous interiors provide a delightful space of respite for the consumption of fantastic cocktails and wines as well as delicious food like the sous vide chicken, pictured (that is not yet part of the regular menu)",43
Emily Kawski,1830,a year ago,What a lovely space! Have been dying to check it out. Came in for a quick drink. The bar is small and it was packed but they allowed me to order at the counter and stand. Drinks were great. Love that they use New Liberty products. But the real showstopper IMO is the space. Dripping with French Nouveau vibes everywhere. Well done!!,43
Deanna McN,1831,a month ago,Took over an hour for them to make our food. Extremely overpriced and very small portions. The food tasted okay but for how much it cost combined with the long wait time I was expecting much more.,43
Julián Sánchez González,1832,4 months ago,"Food quality, flavor, and portions need to be improved. Service time was slow. Atmosphere beautiful and great for a drink but would not recommend for dinner.",43
acaney,1833,5 months ago,Disappointed with the expensive food. The Rival coffee was good but my quiche was not. It was spongy and tasteless. The bill came to $70. for two without alcohol or dessert.  I would only go there again for the atmosphere and coffee,43
Renee,1834,10 months ago,"Beautiful design
Wouldn’t say it’s the best place for getting work done, as it feels more like a restaurant than a cafe even in the daytime
Would definitely come back to get a meal with friends though",43
Dayce Schrieber,1835,8 months ago,"Absolutely delicious! Incredibly creative chef!  The Rival bros espresso was nice and rich with a bit of sweetness.
Fresh baked bread with the fermented strawberry butter was amazing. Excellent …",43
Katherine Morris,1836,7 months ago,"The place is beautiful. Bad wait staff. Got about 4 drinks and asked for a snack with the food which they brought out the tiniest Chex mix bowl. When I asked for more, we were told the chef does not allow them give out more. The waitress …",43
J W,1837,5 months ago,Visiting from another country and needed to receive an email in an emergency. WiFi “is turned off“ after lunch. Empty tables but only option given was to stand at the coffee bar or be outside in metal chairs in the cold. Too bright and loud. Prices don’t justify the experience.,43
Rachel Walsh,1838,a year ago,"Cocktails are very good and there is a nice variety of versatile options on the menu. I especially recommend the Bramble and Hayward. We were quoted at a 20 minute wait and waited for over an hour, which left something to be desired. Food …",43
Steve Flanagan,1839,11 months ago,"Atmosphere was great and our server was super nice, but wow was the food gross. The fried chicken and caviar was a pile of fried breading with two pieces of DRY chicken. The duck fries were good, but the dipping sauce was weirdly vinegar …",43

David Kazarov,1840,a year ago,"Had an absolutely wonderful evening here the other night with a friend. The food, drinks, service, and atmosphere were all on point. Every single thing we got rocked the house, all served up in their tastefully-designed dining room which …",43

Maria Jose Fuentes,1842,a year ago,"This was a stellar dinner and drinks place. We were told that our wait was around 30 minutes for 4 people, but were seated promptly and well before then. The food was DELICIOUS, and our drinks were well made. We felt our server was …",43
Lyndsey Getty,1843,a year ago,Love. Drinks are inventive and delicious. The haymaker is great if you like to drink dessert. The food is incredible. Best bone marrow I have had in a long time. One critique would be to evenly spread the sugar on the endives as the top layer was very sugary and the bottom layer had none. Service was great.,43
Sam Thomas,1844,7 months ago,"Cocktails were so unique and tasty. Must try the whiskey espresso martini.
Fried chicken and Caviar was also so delicious!",43

David Dee,1849,10 months ago,"First time stopping in, and kicking myself for waiting so long to do so. It was pretty busy, but Kurt took good care of us. Gave us the story of the business, the Pennsylvania liquors, a solid run through of the cocktails. Unique twists on …",43
Anthony Turco,1850,a year ago,"Interior space looks amazing. It’s a smaller spot, that does not take reservations, which is a plus for me. For drinks: the Old Fashioned #2 was an amazing sip, and my wife loved the rooibos gimlet. We ate the bone marrow/clams, chips and …",43
Brittany Martin,1851,a year ago,Service was atrocious. I so rarely review any place but our server had such an attitude and would walk past our table and we basically had to scream to get her attention to order anything. Then we asked if we could have extra sauce for an …,43
Andrew Sane,1852,a year ago,"I recently visited Enswell with my family, and I must say that the service we received was nothing short of abysmal. From the moment we were seated, it was clear that our presence was being overlooked and disregarded. …",43
Lars Betschart,1853,a month ago,"Cozy dinning experience, the food was perfect and every dish itself just wow!",43
T Harrison,1854,a year ago,"Brett welcomed, did a follow up and ensured we had the best Anniversary. We drove from Virginia, 4 1/2 hours to spend an evening and it didn't disappoint. Xavier took gracious care of us and Kiahna went above and beyond to make it a night to remember. Thank you. It was better than the great expectations we had.",43

Emery Chew,1859,2 months ago,"The service and atmosphere were great. The food was quite expensive, bland, and a little gross.",43
Matt Feldman,1860,a year ago,"Enswell is a beautiful space, reminding me of something out of a Wes Anderson film. The seating is limited & no reservations offered. If you're lucky enough to get a seat for cocktails, do not sleep on the food menu. The head chef, Andrew …",43
Alaina C,1861,8 months ago,This place is incredible! The food and drinks were amazing and very reasonably priced for the quality. The service + staff were phenomenal. This might be my favorite restaurant in Philly.,43
Tala Fakhoury,1862,a year ago,"The foods and drinks were okay. Prices are good, but I’m really just leaving a review because the service was not great. The staff seemed to not be happy customers were there, and kept pushing for the check as if they wanted to kick us out. …",43
